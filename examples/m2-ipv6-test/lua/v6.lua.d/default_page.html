<h1>Test V6</h1>

<p>
Hello. 
</p>
<p>
If you are wondering what would happen if you "switched on IPv6" on your server, this may help you get a feel of it.
</p>

<p>Add this tag: 
<strike title="Opera browser does not request the images with the 'display:none' style. Thanks to David Croft for noting this.">&lt;img src="counter.gif" style="display:none"&gt;</strike>
<b>&lt;img src="http://testv6.stdio.be/v6.lua/counter.gif" style="width:0px;height:0px"&gt; </b>
to the bottom of your page to monitor the v6-readiness of your audience.  We track aggregates by referer.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, if your referer is not constant (e.g. you put it on the page that accepts parameters in a GET request), then the reporting will be scattered (remember - we track by referer, in fact by referer sha1 hash). Same thing if your site is accessible via multiple domains. To fix that, you can supply "?r=your.fixed.referer.value" query string in the img tag URL - and then use that referral value when retrieving reports. 
</p>
<p>
Example: 
<b>&lt;img src="http://testv6.stdio.be/v6.lua/counter.gif?r=http://www.stdio.be/" style="width:0px;height:0px"&gt;</b>
</p>
<p>
How: The browser requests the image. The testv6.stdio.be has only an A-record and sits on IPv4-only DNS. So, it is no different from any other IPv4-only website on the Internet. We do not serve an image right away, but instead send a redirect (302) to a domain that has both A and AAAA (hence, it models the "IPv6-enabled" domain. 
</p>
<p>
When the client comes back - we send them to the domain that has only AAAA record - so, it's IPv6-only. If that succeeds, we try to also send them a bigger chunk of data in the reply - to test for possible MTU breakages. Finally, we send them to the domain that AAAA-only, and is served via DNS server that is only IPv6-reachable. 
</p>
<p>
Frequently, some clients will be "lost" at one of the stages of this 302-marathon. This is what you will see in the report.
From the practical standpoint of enabling the IPv6 on the website, most important is to keep an eye of how many clients will be lost with "A+AAAA". 
</p>
<p>
When there are some hits, you can go and view the report.

1 May 2010: Added the DNS6 AAAA record test - thanks to Steve Bertrand for the help! Consequently, I reset the database.

About: This small service is built using lighttpd, redis, and Lua. It runs on a Xen VPS with 128Mb of RAM and is able to service approximately 25 requests per second. 
This app is running on top of a Lua web microframework that I called <a href="http://github.com/ayourtch/gliese">Gliese</a>.
If you are interested to get yourself a copy of this script, or have some feedback about this service, drop an email to ayourtch at the gmail email address.
