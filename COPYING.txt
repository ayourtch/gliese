A big chunk of this library is taken from CGILua:

http://keplerproject.github.com/cgilua/

The FastCGI wrapper is a slightly tweaked Jan Kneschke's for lighttpd:

The Redis client is Daniele Alessandri's:

http://github.com/nrk/redis-lua

The vast majority of whatever is left, is written by Andrew Yourtchenko and is MIT-licensed.

Below go the blurbs of license texts.

====== cgilua:

CGILua is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1.

====== FastCGI wrapper:

Clarification from Jan Kneschke: the wrapper is MIT/X11 license (same as Lua 5.1)

====== redis-lua:
